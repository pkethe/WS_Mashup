2) Node.js


Once there are no dependencies.

1) Do npm install on bash and install all the frameworks required by node.js

2) Node modules have not been uploaded as part of submission, so step 1 is mandatory.

3) Once node modules are installed, create a database in mongodb with PA3.

4) Start node using 

		# node app.js

	app.js is entry point for the program.
